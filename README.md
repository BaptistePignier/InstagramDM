# InstagramDM

My first android app

## Why
First, I consider that I'm an instagram addict. So I told myself that I had to uninstall this evil app. But instagram's direct messages represent a main commnication 
way for me and my friend. So I searched a way to keep instagram DM without instagram app. But I had found nothing so I started to learn android coding.

## How
I had no idea how to do this. But thank to internet and stackoverflow, everything is possible. I reuse my old android from scratch project to start.

## Not a final project
As I said, this app is an embryo. I tested this app a lot to fix all the bugs I found but I can't guarantee a correct functioning. Also, there is a lot of room for improvement. I think I will never continue this project. The goal wasn't publish an final app but to compile all knowledges I have acquired on the web into one app. Moreover, many process of this app aren't optimized. I didn't use AndroidX packages so many component are alse deprecated. This app was made without android studio and without additionnal debugging tool : logging was a good friend XD.
This app was tested only on my personnal device : a Redmi Note 7 by Xiaomi.
